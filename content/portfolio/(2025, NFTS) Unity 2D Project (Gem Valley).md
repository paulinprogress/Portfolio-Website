# Gem Valley

A short 2D [[platformer]] built in [[Unity]] as part of a workshop during my NFTS indie game development certificate course (early 2025).

The goal was to practice core Unity systems â€“ like tilemaps, timelines, and animation. I took some time afterwards to finish the level and add some polish.

I even made a cute intro:

Key Features:

- [[Level Design]] with [[Tilemaps]]
- Collectable gems & power-ups
- Using timelines & animations for intro, game over, etc.
- Audio & music implementation, including randomized footstep sounds
- Menus & other basic UI elements
