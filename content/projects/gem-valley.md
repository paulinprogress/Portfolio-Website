# Gem Valley

A short 2D platformer built in Unity as part of a workshop during my NFTS certificate course in Indie Games Development (early 2025).

Despite being familiar with Unity before, it deepened my understanding of many core systems:

- Level design with tilemaps (layered, animated, with collision)
- Implementing collectable gems & power-ups
- Using timelines for intro animation, win & game over screens, etc.
- Audio & music implementation, including randomized footstep sounds
- Menus & other basic UI elements
