# Gem Valley

This is a short 2D [[platformer]] built in [[Unity]] as part of a workshop during my NFTS indie game development certificate course (early 2025).

The goal was to practice core Unity systems â€“ like tilemaps, timelines, and animation. I took some time afterwards to finish the level and add some polish.

Key Learnings:

- [[Level design]] with [[tilemaps]]
- Implementing collectable gems & power-ups
- Using timelines for intro animation, win & game over screens, etc.
- Audio & music implementation, including randomized footstep sounds
- Menus & other basic UI elements
