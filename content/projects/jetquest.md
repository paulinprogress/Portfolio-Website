# JetQuest

A collaboration with [JustinGonsalves](https://justingonsalves.itch.io/) created in one week for [Jame Gam #55](https://itch.io/jam/jame-gam-55), built around the themes “Mobility” and “Gorge”.

We opted for a fun, arcady flying game with a retro look, focused on risky, mobility-driven challenges set in a canyon environment. You complete challenges to earn points and unlock new spaceships. Along the way, you can collect pickups for bonus points or fuel, but you must land before running out of fuel in order to stash your points, select new challenges, or upgrade your ship.

We started by adopting a simple airplane controller, scripting the challenge system and building the level. Big learnings for me included working with Unity’s Scriptable Objects (neatly organizing and handling the data for different ships and challenges), as well as the Terrain tool with which I painted the environment.

Our entry landed the 1st spot in theme implementation and 6th overall, making it a pretty rewarding outcome for us! Following some of the feedback we got, I also experimented with an option to lock the camera, although I find it a bit nauseating… (see below)
