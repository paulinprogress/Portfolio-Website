# Last Block Standing

A simple [[bullet hell]] game where you place blocks to shield yourself from incoming projectiles.

Created solo in 48 hours for the [PULS GAME JAM](https://itch.io/jam/puls-game-jam), under the theme *Kaputt*. Given the limited time, I focused on building a simple but escalating challenge, with a core mechanic that encourages quick thinking and spatial strategy.
