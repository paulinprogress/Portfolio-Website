# Flat Frenzy

![[(2025) Flat Frenzy (Feature).webp]]

Another project from my my NFTS indie game development certificate course (early 2025). The assignment was to create a [[Game Design Documents|game design document]] for any kind of game suitable to the indie market.

“Flat Frenzy” is a top-down [[couch co-op]] party game where 2–4 players struggle to complete their daily chores in a cramped, messy shared flat—all within a towering student housing complex. Each in-game week, the Student Housing Board (SHB) evaluates the apartment’s messiness and determines whether players move up to better flats or get stuck in the chaos below. Cooperation is necessary, but selfishness and chaos are inevitable.
