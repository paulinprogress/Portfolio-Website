# SpotifAI

In the fall semester 2021/22 of my Media Technology bachelor, I took an introductory course on [[Machine Learning]]. I previously had only a surface-level understanding of the topic, but with an affinity for programming, it turned out to be really intuitive and intriguing, especially since you could get a practical AI-based system working surprisingly quickly.

For the final project of the course, me and two classmates built a web app for controlling Spotify with AI-detected hand gestures (play/pause, skip, like, etc.), going through all stages of implementation – dataset creation & curation, model setup & training, integration & deployment.

Here’s how it looked:

The experience taught me a lot and laid the groundwork for my internship and [[(2024) Bachelorarbeit (BA)|bachelor’s thesis]] later on.
