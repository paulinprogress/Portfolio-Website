# Internal Review

Solo submission to [GMTK Jam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2025), created in 4 days for the theme “loop”.

I chose to make a surreal first-person exploration game set in a liminal office space. You navigate a series of doors, some looping back to earlier rooms, while each door poses increasingly strange and intrusive questions. The mechanic and narrative work together to represent the feeling of being trapped in a cycle with a toxic person in one’s life.

This project pushed me to quickly prototype in 3D, with a focus on atmosphere and systems design. I built a dynamic spawning/despawning system for rooms and corridors, which kept performance stable while reinforcing the endless, looping structure of the game.

I also made use of [Twine](https://twinery.org/) for mapping out all the different rooms, paths, and questions, which turned out to be really helpful:
